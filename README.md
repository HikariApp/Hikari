  <h1>Hikari</h1>
  <h3>Discord bot's application. Reimagined.</h3>
</div>

<br>

Powered by [discord.py][discord.py_GitHub] with my custom template.

Inherited from **Skylar <3**, which is also a discord bot that **never been published before**. I planned to release on a later stage after almost 2 yrs of development originally but with total failure unfortuneately due to the *unexpected termination*

A much detailed documenatation will be provided on a later stage.

> [!WARNING]
> Being incredibly a work in progress and time constrain under poor code mangaement, Hikari should be used, for now, with caution.

> [!NOTE]
> A full code refactor is scheduled to increase readability once I have enough spare time to do so. In addtion, I know that both discord.py and Python itself has relatively slow performance. Since this project was inherited from one of my earliest projects as I mentioned above, I may consider a **complete rewrite** using **discord.js** or other frameworks in the future, if feasible.

## What can Hikari do for now?

Hikari has now been equipped with these functions:
- Server moderation
   - Banning users
   - Muting users
   - Timeout users
- AI chatbot (powered by ChatGPT)
- Music player (streaming online or play files uploaded from your client)
- Getting an vaild discord user information or avatar
- Writing an embed for you (Only works with server invitation)

and so much more... (waiting for your discovery ðŸ˜‰)

## Getting Started

The simplest way to use Hikari is to use the publicly hosted instance of it, and we already have one over **[here][Bot_outh_link]**.

You can either invite the bot to your server, or install it as a **user-installed application** as you prefer.

## Future implemtations

The name of Hikari stands for light, and of course we'll have to keep her bright! :D

Here're some implemtations we've already planned and will likely be deployed later on

- **Role Management**: Allow the bot to assign or remove roles from users.
- **Mutiligual-support**: Allow user to change the language of the bot by modifing server settings or regional settings
